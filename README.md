# Project: Scikit-Learn Tutorial


### Overview

The Python programming language is a great option for data science and predictive analytics, as it comes equipped with multiple packages which cover most of your data analysis needs. For machine learning in Python, Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a great option and is built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib (N-dimensional arrays, scientific computing, and data visualization respectively).
In this tutorial, you'll see how you can easily load in data from a database with sqlite3, how you can explore your data and improve its data quality with pandas and matplotlib, and how you can then use the Scikit-Learn package to extract some valid insights out of your data.

## Part 1: Predicting MLB Team Wins per Season

In this project, youâ€™ll test out several machine learning models from sklearn to predict the number of games that a Major-League Baseball team won that season, based on the teams statistics and other variables from that season.  The following scikit-learn models are featured in this project:

- K-means clustor
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression


### Results

Created a Ridge Regression model that predicted team wins with an absolute mean error of 2.673 wins per season


## Part II: Predicting Hall of Fame Careers

In this project, you'll see how to use classification models to predict which players make it into the MLB Hall of Fame.

### Results

Work in Progress
